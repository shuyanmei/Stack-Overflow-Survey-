# Stack-Overflow-Survey-2017

This project explores the stack overflow 2017 survey data for developers.

The motivation of this project is to find out how satisfied the developers are with their jobs, what drives their job satisfaction, what are the reasons they want to quit and what they are looking for in the next position? These findings certainly can help us improve employee engagement.

This repository contains a jupyter notebook file which has all the data exploration, including calculate statistics and visualizations.

Some of the python libraries used here are pandas, numpy and matplotlib.
